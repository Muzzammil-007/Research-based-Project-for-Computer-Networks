A Vehicle Lane-Changing Model in Tunnel Area Based on V2X Environment

 The research paper proposes a vehicle lane-changing model in tunnel areas based on the V2X environment. The study analyzes how brightness and noise affect a driver's lane-changing decision intention and response time. The proposed model takes into account these effects to ensure that lane changes are made safely. This research provides valuable insights into improving road safety in tunnel areas using V2X technology, which can be used to reduce accidents and improve traffic flow.
